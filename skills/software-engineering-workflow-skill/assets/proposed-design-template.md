| v1 | Initial draft |  | 1 |

## Summary

## Goals

## Non-Goals

## Legacy Removal Policy (Mandatory)

- Policy: `No backward compatibility; remove legacy code paths.`
- Required action: identify and remove obsolete legacy paths/files included in this scope.

## Requirements And Use Cases

## Codebase Understanding Snapshot (Pre-Design Mandatory)

| Area | Findings | Evidence (files/functions) | Open Unknowns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entrypoints / Boundaries |  |  |  |
| Current Naming Conventions |  |  |  |
| Impacted Modules / Responsibilities |  |  |  |
| Data / Persistence / External IO |  |  |  |

## Current State (As-Is)

## Target State (To-Be)

## Change Inventory (Delta)

| Change ID | Change Type (`Add`/`Modify`/`Rename/Move`/`Remove`) | Current Path | Target Path | Rationale | Impacted Areas | Notes |

## Architecture Overview

## File And Module Breakdown

| File/Module | Change Type | Concern / Responsibility | Public APIs | Inputs/Outputs | Dependencies |

## Naming Decisions (Natural And Implementation-Friendly)

| Item Type (`File`/`Module`/`API`) | Current Name | Proposed Name | Reason | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Dependency Flow And Cross-Reference Risk

| Module/File | Upstream Dependencies | Downstream Dependents | Cross-Reference Risk | Mitigation / Boundary Strategy |

## Data Models (If Needed)

## Error Handling And Edge Cases

## Use-Case Coverage Matrix (Design Gate)

| use_case_id | Use Case | Primary Path Covered (`Yes`/`No`) | Fallback Path Covered (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`) | Error Path Covered (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`) | Runtime Call Stack Section |

## Performance / Security Considerations

## Migration / Rollout (If Needed)

## Change Traceability To Implementation Plan
