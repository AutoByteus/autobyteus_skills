# Runtime Call Stack Review

Use this document as the pre-implementation gate for runtime-call-stack quality and use-case completeness.

## Review Basis

- Runtime Call Stack Document: `tickets/<ticket-name>/design-based-runtime-call-stack.md`
- Source Design Basis:
  - `Small`: `tickets/<ticket-name>/implementation-plan.md`
  - `Medium/Large`: `tickets/<ticket-name>/proposed-design.md`

## Per-Use-Case Review

| Use Case | Business Flow Completeness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Gap Findings | Structure & SoC Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Dependency Flow Smells | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Findings

- If no findings, write `None`.
- Otherwise list only actionable findings:
  - `[F-001] Use case: ... | Type: Gap/Structure/Dependency | Evidence: ... | Required update: ...`

## Gate Decision

- Implementation can start: `Yes` / `No`
- If `No`, required refinement actions:
  - Update proposed design doc and/or implementation plan:
  - Regenerate `design-based-runtime-call-stack.md`:
  - Re-run this review:
