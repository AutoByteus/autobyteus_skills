  default_prompt: "Use $software-engineering-workflow-skill with strict stage gates: for Small scope, draft implementation-plan solution sketch first as design input; for Medium/Large, design first. Then produce proposed-design-based runtime call stacks as future-state (`to-be`) execution models (not as-is code traces), run iterative runtime-call-stack review (Medium minimum 3 rounds with rounds 1-2 mandatory No-Go; Large minimum 5 rounds with rounds 1-4 mandatory No-Go), and only after final gate pass finalize implementation plan + create progress tracking."
