  default_prompt: "Use $software-engineering-workflow-skill with strict stage gates: for Small scope, draft implementation-plan solution sketch first as design input; for Medium/Large, design first. Then produce design-based runtime call stacks, run iterative runtime-call-stack review (Medium/Large minimum 2 rounds; round 1 diagnostic and cannot unlock implementation), and only after final gate pass finalize implementation plan + create progress tracking."
