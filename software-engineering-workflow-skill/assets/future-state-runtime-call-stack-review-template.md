# Future-State Runtime Call Stack Review

Use this document as the pre-implementation gate for future-state runtime-call-stack quality and use-case completeness.
This review validates alignment with target (`to-be`) design behavior, not parity with current (`as-is`) code.

## Review Meta

- Scope Classification: `Small` / `Medium` / `Large`
- Current Round: `1` / `2` / `3` / ...
- Current Review Type: `Deep Review`
- Clean-Review Streak Before This Round: `0` / `1` / `2` / ...
- Clean-Review Streak After This Round: `0` / `1` / `2` / ...
- Round State: `Reset` / `Candidate Go` / `Go Confirmed`

## Review Basis

- Requirements: `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/requirements.md` (status `Design-ready`/`Refined`)
- Runtime Call Stack Document: `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/future-state-runtime-call-stack.md`
- Source Design Basis:
  - `Small`: `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/implementation-plan.md` (solution sketch)
  - `Medium/Large`: `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/proposed-design.md`
- Artifact Versions In This Round:
  - Requirements Status:
  - Design Version:
  - Call Stack Version:
- Required Write-Backs Completed For This Round: `Yes` / `No` / `N/A`

## Review Intent (Mandatory)

- Primary check: Is the future-state runtime call stack a coherent and implementable future-state model?
- Not a pass criterion: matching current-code call paths exactly.
- Not a required action: adding/removing layers by default; `Keep` can pass when layering is coherent and boundary placement is clear.
- Local-fix-is-not-enough rule: if a fix works functionally but degrades architecture/layering/responsibility boundaries, mark `Fail` and require architectural write-back.
- Any finding with a required design/call-stack update is blocking.

## Round History

| Round | Requirements Status | Design Version | Call Stack Version | Findings Requiring Write-Back | Write-Backs Completed | Clean Streak After Round | Round State | Gate (`Go`/`No-Go`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  |  |  | Yes/No | Yes/No/N/A | 0/1/2+ | Reset/Candidate Go/Go Confirmed |  |
| 2 |  |  |  | Yes/No | Yes/No/N/A | 0/1/2+ | Reset/Candidate Go/Go Confirmed |  |
| 3 |  |  |  | Yes/No | Yes/No/N/A | 0/1/2+ | Reset/Candidate Go/Go Confirmed |  |
| N |  |  |  | Yes/No | Yes/No/N/A | 0/1/2+ | Reset/Candidate Go/Go Confirmed |  |

Notes:
- No fixed round count is hard-coded.
- `Candidate Go` means one clean deep-review round with no blockers and no required write-backs.
- `Go Confirmed` means two consecutive clean deep-review rounds.

## Round Write-Back Log (Mandatory)

| Round | Findings Requiring Updates (`Yes`/`No`) | Updated Files | Version Changes | Changed Sections | Resolved Finding IDs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| N |  |  |  |  |  |

Rule:
- A round is incomplete until required file updates are physically written and logged.

## Per-Use-Case Review

| Use Case | Architecture Fit (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Layering Fitness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Boundary Placement (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Existing-Structure Bias Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Anti-Hack Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Local-Fix Degradation Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Terminology & Concept Naturalness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | File/API Naming Clarity (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Name-to-Responsibility Alignment Under Scope Drift (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Future-State Alignment With Design Basis (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Use-Case Coverage Completeness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Business Flow Completeness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Layer-Appropriate SoC Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Dependency Flow Smells | Redundancy/Duplication Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Simplification Opportunity Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Remove/Decommission Completeness (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | No Legacy/Backward-Compat Branches (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UC-001 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Findings

- If no findings, write `None`.
- Otherwise list only actionable findings:
  - `[F-001] Use case: ... | Type: Architecture/Layering/Hack/LocalFixDegradation/Vocabulary/Naming/Gap/Structure/Dependency/Redundancy/Simplification/Legacy/Decommission | Severity: Blocker/Major/Minor | Evidence: ... | Required update: ...`

Rule:
- Any finding with a `Required update` is blocking and must be resolved in a later review round before implementation can start.

## Blocking Findings Summary

- Unresolved Blocking Findings: `Yes` / `No`
- Remove/Decommission Checks Complete For Scoped `Remove`/`Rename/Move`: `Yes` / `No` / `N/A`

## Gate Decision

- Implementation can start: `Yes` / `No`
- Clean-review streak at end of this round:
- Gate rule checks (all must be `Yes` for `Implementation can start = Yes`):
  - Architecture fit is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Layering fitness is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Boundary placement is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Existing-structure bias check is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Anti-hack check is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Local-fix degradation check is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Terminology and concept vocabulary is natural/intuitive across in-scope use cases:
  - File/API naming clarity is `Pass` across in-scope use cases:
  - Name-to-responsibility alignment under scope drift is `Pass` across in-scope use cases:
  - Future-state alignment with target design basis is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Layer-appropriate structure and separation of concerns is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Use-case coverage completeness is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Redundancy/duplication check is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - Simplification opportunity check is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases:
  - All use-case verdicts are `Pass`:
  - No unresolved blocking findings:
  - Required write-backs completed for this round:
  - Remove/decommission checks complete for scoped `Remove`/`Rename/Move` changes:
  - Two consecutive deep-review rounds have no blockers and no required write-backs:
  - Findings trend quality is acceptable across rounds (issues declined in count/severity or became more localized), or explicit design decomposition update is recorded:
- If `No`, required refinement actions:
  - Update `requirements.md` first if this is a `Requirement Gap` (status `Refined`), then update design basis:
  - Regenerate `future-state-runtime-call-stack.md`:
  - Re-run this review from updated files:
