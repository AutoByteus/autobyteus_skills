# Implementation Progress

This document tracks implementation and testing progress in real time, including file-level execution, API/E2E testing outcomes, code review outcomes, blockers, and escalation paths.

## When To Use This Document

- Create this file at implementation kickoff after pre-implementation gates are complete:
  - `workflow-state.md` exists and is current,
  - investigation notes written and current,
  - requirements at least `Design-ready`,
  - future-state runtime call stack review gate is `Go Confirmed` (two consecutive clean deep-review rounds with no blockers, no required persisted artifact updates, and no newly discovered use cases),
  - implementation plan finalized.
- Update it continuously during implementation (Stage 6), API/E2E testing (Stage 7), code review (Stage 8), and docs sync (Stage 9).
- Record every meaningful change immediately: file status transitions, test status changes, blockers, classification decisions, escalation actions, and scenario results.

## Kickoff Preconditions Checklist

- Workflow state is current (`tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/workflow-state.md`):
- `workflow-state.md` shows `Current Stage = 6` and `Code Edit Permission = Unlocked` before source edits:
- Scope classification confirmed (`Small`/`Medium`/`Large`):
- Investigation notes are current (`tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/investigation-notes.md`):
- Requirements status is `Design-ready` or `Refined`:
- Runtime review final gate is `Implementation can start: Yes`:
- Runtime review reached `Go Confirmed` with two consecutive clean deep-review rounds (no blockers, no required persisted artifact updates, no newly discovered use cases):
- No unresolved blocking findings:

## Scope Change Log

| Date | Previous Scope | New Scope | Trigger | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Small | Medium | Example: architectural complexity exceeded small-scope assumptions | Follow classified re-entry path (`Design Impact`: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`, `Requirement Gap`: `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`, `Unclear`: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`), rerun review to `Go Confirmed`, then resume implementation. |

## File-Level Progress Table (Stage 6)

| Change ID | Change Type | Spine ID(s) | Owner | File | Depends On | File Status | Unit Test File | Unit Test Status | Integration Test File | Integration Test Status | Last Failure Classification | Last Failure Investigation Required | Cross-Reference Smell | Design Follow-Up | Requirement Follow-Up | Last Verified | Verification Command | Notes |

## API/E2E Testing Scenario Log (Stage 7)

| Date | Scenario ID | Spine ID(s) | Governing Owner | Source Type (`Requirement`/`Design-Risk`) | Acceptance Criteria ID(s) | Requirement ID(s) | Use Case ID(s) | Level (`API`/`E2E`) | Status | Failure Summary | Investigation Required (`Yes`/`No`) | Classification (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`) | Action Path Taken | `investigation-notes.md` Updated | Requirements Updated | Design Updated | Call Stack Regenerated | Resume Condition Met |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | AV-001 | DS-001 | ExampleOwner | Requirement | AC-001 | R-001 | UC-001 | API | Failed | Missing flow branch for fallback path | Yes | Design Impact | Re-entered `Stage 1 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6 -> Stage 7` before retry | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Rules:
- Stage 6 failure classification (before Stage 7):
  - `Local Fix`: stay in `Stage 6` and resolve implementation/tests locally.
  - `Design Impact`: re-enter `Stage 1 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6` before continuing implementation.
  - `Requirement Gap`: re-enter `Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6` before continuing implementation.
  - `Unclear`/cross-cutting root cause: re-enter `Stage 0 -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6` before continuing implementation.
- If issue scope is large/cross-cutting or root-cause confidence is low, `Investigation Required` must be `Yes` and understanding-stage re-entry is required before requirements/design updates.
- `Local Fix` requires artifact update first, then fix, then rerun `Stage 6 -> Stage 7` before retry.
- `Design Impact` requires full-chain re-entry: `Stage 1 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6 -> Stage 7`.
- `Requirement Gap` requires full-chain re-entry: `Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6 -> Stage 7`.
- `Unclear`/cross-cutting root cause requires full-chain re-entry from understanding: `Stage 0 -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6 -> Stage 7`.
- If a would-be fix depends on wrong module/file placement, reclassify it as `Design Impact` before further source edits.
- Stage 0 in a re-entry path means re-open bootstrap controls in the same ticket/worktree (`workflow-state.md`, lock state, artifact baselines); do not create a new ticket folder.
- No source code edits before required upstream artifacts are updated and logged.

## Acceptance Criteria Closure Matrix (Stage 7 Gate)

| Date | Acceptance Criteria ID | Requirement ID | Scenario ID(s) | Coverage Status (`Unmapped`/`Not Run`/`Passed`/`Failed`/`Blocked`/`Waived`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | AC-001 | R-001 | AV-001 | Failed | API response contract missing required field. |

Rules:
- Every in-scope acceptance criterion from `requirements.md` must appear in this matrix.
- Any row not at `Passed` or `Waived` keeps Stage 7 open and requires re-entry before retry.
- Stage 7 cannot be marked complete while any row is `Unmapped`, `Not Run`, `Failed`, or `Blocked` unless explicitly marked `Waived` by user decision for infeasible cases.

## Spine Coverage Matrix (Stage 7 Gate)

| Date | Spine ID | Spine Scope (`Primary End-to-End`/`Return-Event`/`Bounded Local`) | Governing Owner | Scenario ID(s) | Coverage Status (`Unmapped`/`Planned`/`Passed`/`Failed`/`Blocked`/`N/A`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | DS-001 | Primary End-to-End | ExampleOwner | AV-001 | Failed | Fallback branch on this spine is still missing. |

Rules:
- Every relevant spine from the approved design basis must appear in this matrix.
- Any relevant executable spine not at `Passed` keeps Stage 7 open unless explicitly `N/A` with rationale.

## API/E2E Feasibility Record

- API/E2E scenarios feasible in current environment: `Yes` / `No`
- If `No`, concrete infeasibility reason:
- Current environment constraints (tokens/secrets/third-party dependency/access limits):
- Best-available compensating automated evidence:
- Residual risk accepted:
- Explicit user waiver for infeasible acceptance criteria: `Yes` / `No`
- Waiver reference (if `Yes`):

## Code Review Log (Stage 8)

| Date | Review Round | File | Effective Non-Empty Lines | Adds/Expands Functionality (`Yes`/`No`) | `>500` Hard-Limit Check | `>220` Changed-Line Delta Gate | Data-Flow Spine Inventory Preservation (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Scope-Appropriate SoC Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Module/File Placement Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Validation Evidence Sufficiency (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Classification (`Local Fix`/`Validation Gap`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`) | Re-Entry Declaration Recorded | Upstream Artifacts Updated Before Code Edit | Decision (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | 1 | `src/example-a.ts` | 615 | Yes | Fail | Fail | Pass | Fail | Pass | Pass | Design Impact | Yes | Yes | Fail | Exceeded `>500` hard limit and mixed too much responsibility in one file; returned to `Stage 1 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 6 -> Stage 7 -> Stage 8` before further edits. |

Rules:
- Include source and test files in review scope.
- Measure each changed source file with:
  - effective non-empty line count: `rg -n "\\S" <file-path> | wc -l`
  - changed-line delta: `git diff --numstat <base-ref>...HEAD -- <file-path>`
- Enforcement baseline uses effective non-empty line count.
- If any changed source file has effective non-empty line count `>500`, default classification is `Design Impact` and `Decision = Fail`.
- For `>500` hard-limit cases, do not proceed to Stage 9; apply re-entry mapping first and then rerun `Stage 6 -> Stage 7 -> Stage 8`.
- No soft middle band (`501-700`) and no default exception path in this workflow.
- If a single changed source file has `>220` changed lines in current diff, record a design-impact assessment even when effective file size is `<=500`.
- For `Fail`, do not proceed to `Stage 9`; apply re-entry mapping first and rerun `Stage 6 -> Stage 7 -> Stage 8`.
- If the main issue is insufficient Stage 7 coverage/evidence rather than code/design drift, classify as `Validation Gap` and rerun `Stage 7 -> Stage 8`.
- Any scope-appropriate separation-of-concerns failure (mixed unrelated responsibility in one file/module) is blocking and requires classified re-entry before further source edits.
- Any ownership-dependency/decoupling failure (tight coupling or unjustified cycle) is blocking and requires classified re-entry before further source edits.
- Any module/file placement failure (wrong concern folder or unjustified shared placement) is blocking and requires classified re-entry before further source edits.
- Any backward-compatibility mechanism or legacy-retention finding is blocking and requires classified re-entry before further source edits.

## Blocked Items

| File | Blocked By | Unblock Condition | Owner/Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/example-a.ts` | `src/example-core.ts` | Core API finalized and tests pass | Resume implementation after boundary update. |

## Design Feedback Loop Log

| Date | Trigger File(s) | Smell Description | Design Section Updated | Update Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | `src/example-a.ts`, `src/example-core.ts` | Bidirectional dependency caused blocked implementation order. | `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/proposed-design.md` (or `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/implementation-plan.md` solution sketch for `Small`) -> boundary section | In Progress | Introduce boundary interface to remove cross-reference. |

## Remove/Rename/Legacy Cleanup Verification Log

| Date | Change ID | Item | Verification Performed | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | C-003 | `src/example-util.ts` | import/reference scan + targeted tests | Passed | No remaining references. |

## Docs Sync Log (Mandatory Post-Testing + Review)

| Date | Docs Impact (`Updated`/`No impact`) | Files Updated | Rationale | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Updated | `docs/example-feature.md` | Runtime flow changed and new module added | Completed |

## Completion Gate

- Mark `File Status = Completed` only when implementation is done and required tests are passing or explicitly `N/A`.
- For `Rename/Move`/`Remove` tasks, verify obsolete references and dead branches are removed.
- Mark Stage 6 implementation execution complete only when:
  - implementation plan scope is delivered (or deviations are documented),
  - required unit/integration tests pass,
  - no backward-compatibility shims or legacy old-behavior branches remain in scope,
  - ownership-dependency/decoupling checks show no new unjustified tight coupling/cycles,
  - touched files have correct module/file placement or an explicit move/split has been completed.
- Mark Stage 7 API/E2E testing complete only when:
  - every executable in-scope acceptance criterion in the closure matrix is `Passed`,
  - every executable relevant spine in the spine coverage matrix is `Passed`,
  - critical executable API/E2E scenarios pass,
  - any infeasible acceptance criterion has explicit user waiver + documented constraints + compensating evidence + residual risk,
  - required escalation actions (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`) are resolved and logged.
- Mark Stage 8 code review complete only when:
  - `code-review.md` exists and gate decision is recorded,
  - `<=500` hard-limit checks and required `>220` delta-gate assessments are recorded for all changed source files,
  - data-flow spine inventory preservation checks, scope-appropriate separation-of-concerns checks, interface/API/query/command/service-method boundary clarity checks, and validation-evidence sufficiency checks are recorded,
  - module/file placement checks are recorded for all changed source files,
  - if gate decision is `Fail`, re-entry declaration and target stage path are recorded.
- Mark Stage 9 docs sync complete only when docs synchronization result is recorded (`Updated` or `No impact` with rationale).
