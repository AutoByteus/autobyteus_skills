# Implementation Progress

This document tracks implementation and validation progress in real time, including file-level execution, internal code review gate outcomes, aggregated API/E2E validation, blockers, and escalation paths.

## When To Use This Document

- Create this file at implementation kickoff after pre-implementation gates are complete:
  - `workflow-state.md` exists and is current,
  - investigation notes written and current,
  - requirements at least `Design-ready`,
  - future-state runtime call stack review gate is `Go Confirmed` (two consecutive clean deep-review rounds),
  - implementation plan finalized.
- Update it continuously during implementation (Stage 5), internal code review (Stage 5.5), aggregated validation (Stage 6), and docs sync (Stage 7).
- Record every meaningful change immediately: file status transitions, test status changes, blockers, classification decisions, escalation actions, and scenario results.

## Kickoff Preconditions Checklist

- Workflow state is current (`tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/workflow-state.md`):
- `workflow-state.md` shows `Current Stage = 5` and `Code Edit Permission = Unlocked` before source edits:
- Scope classification confirmed (`Small`/`Medium`/`Large`):
- Investigation notes are current (`tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/investigation-notes.md`):
- Requirements status is `Design-ready` or `Refined`:
- Runtime review final gate is `Implementation can start: Yes`:
- Runtime review reached `Go Confirmed` with two consecutive clean deep-review rounds:
- No unresolved blocking findings:

## Progress Log

- YYYY-MM-DD: Implementation kickoff baseline created.

## Scope Change Log

| Date | Previous Scope | New Scope | Trigger | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Small | Medium | Example: architectural complexity exceeded small-scope assumptions | Update requirements/design basis as needed, regenerate call stacks, rerun review to `Go Confirmed`, then resume implementation. |

## File-Level Progress Table (Stage 5)

| Change ID | Change Type | File | Depends On | File Status | Unit Test File | Unit Test Status | Integration Test File | Integration Test Status | Last Failure Classification | Last Failure Investigation Required | Cross-Reference Smell | Design Follow-Up | Requirement Follow-Up | Last Verified | Verification Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-001 | Modify | `src/example-a.ts` | `src/example-core.ts` | Blocked | `tests/unit/example-a.test.ts` | Blocked | `tests/integration/example-a.integration.test.ts` | Failed | Design Impact | Yes | `src/example-a.ts <-> src/example-core.ts` | Needed | Not Needed | YYYY-MM-DD | `pnpm exec vitest --run tests/unit/example-a.test.ts` | Waiting for boundary refactor. |
| C-002 | Add | `src/example-core.ts` | N/A | In Progress | `tests/unit/example-core.test.ts` | In Progress | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | None | Not Needed | Not Needed | YYYY-MM-DD | `pnpm exec vitest --run tests/unit/example-core.test.ts` | Implementing base interfaces. |
| C-003 | Remove | `src/example-util.ts` | N/A | Completed | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | None | Not Needed | Not Needed | YYYY-MM-DD | `rg -n "example-util" src tests` | Utility removed and references cleaned. |

## Internal Code Review Log (Stage 5.5)

| Date | Review Round | File | Source Lines | Adds/Expands Functionality (`Yes`/`No`) | `>300` SoC Check | `>400` Hard Check | Classification (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`) | Re-Entry Declaration Recorded | Upstream Artifacts Updated Before Code Edit | Decision (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | 1 | `src/example-a.ts` | 428 | Yes | Fail | Fail | Design Impact | Yes | Yes | Fail | Returned to Stage 2 chain before further edits. |

Rules:
- Source files only (exclude tests).
- If changed source file line count is `>300`, explicit SoC assessment is mandatory.
- If changed source file line count is `>400` and functionality is expanded, default classification is `Design Impact` and `Decision = Fail` unless explicit exception rationale exists.
- For `Fail`, do not proceed to `Stage 6`; apply re-entry mapping first.

## Aggregated API/E2E Validation Scenario Log (Stage 6)

| Date | Scenario ID | Source Type (`Requirement`/`Design-Risk`) | Acceptance Criteria ID(s) | Requirement ID(s) | Use Case ID(s) | Level (`API`/`E2E`) | Status | Failure Summary | Investigation Required (`Yes`/`No`) | Classification (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`) | Action Path Taken | `investigation-notes.md` Updated | Requirements Updated | Design Updated | Call Stack Regenerated | Review Re-Entry Round | Resume Condition Met |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | AV-001 | Requirement | AC-001 | R-001 | UC-001 | API | Failed | Missing flow branch for fallback path | Yes | Design Impact | Paused implementation, reopened investigation, then updated design basis | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Round 6 | Yes |

Rules:
- If issue scope is large/cross-cutting or root-cause confidence is low, `Investigation Required` must be `Yes` and understanding-stage re-entry is required before requirements/design updates.
- `Local Fix` requires artifact update first, then fix, then rerun `Stage 5` + `Stage 5.5` before rerunning affected scenarios.
- `Design Impact` always requires an investigation checkpoint first (`Investigation Required = Yes`): update `investigation-notes.md` before design write-backs.
- If requirement-level gaps are discovered during the design-impact investigation checkpoint, reclassify to `Requirement Gap` and follow the requirement-gap path.
- `Design Impact` (after checkpoint, still design impact) requires full-chain re-entry: `Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 5.5`.
- `Requirement Gap` requires full-chain re-entry: `Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 5.5`.
- unclear/cross-cutting root cause requires full-chain re-entry from understanding: `Stage 0 -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 4 -> Stage 5 -> Stage 5.5`.
- No source code edits before required upstream artifacts are updated and logged.

## Acceptance Criteria Closure Matrix (Stage 6 Gate)

| Date | Acceptance Criteria ID | Requirement ID | Scenario ID(s) | Coverage Status (`Unmapped`/`Not Run`/`Passed`/`Failed`/`Blocked`/`Waived`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | AC-001 | R-001 | AV-001 | Failed | API response contract missing required field. |

Rules:
- Every in-scope acceptance criterion from `requirements.md` must appear in this matrix.
- Any row not at `Passed` or `Waived` keeps Stage 6 open and requires re-entry before retry.
- Stage 6 cannot be marked complete while any row is `Unmapped`, `Not Run`, `Failed`, or `Blocked` unless explicitly marked `Waived` by user decision for infeasible cases.

## Aggregated Validation Feasibility Record

- API/E2E scenarios feasible in current environment: `Yes` / `No`
- If `No`, concrete infeasibility reason:
- Current environment constraints (tokens/secrets/third-party dependency/access limits):
- Best-available compensating automated evidence:
- Residual risk accepted:
- Explicit user waiver for infeasible acceptance criteria: `Yes` / `No`
- Waiver reference (if `Yes`):

## Blocked Items

| File | Blocked By | Unblock Condition | Owner/Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/example-a.ts` | `src/example-core.ts` | Core API finalized and tests pass | Resume implementation after boundary update. |

## Design Feedback Loop Log

| Date | Trigger File(s) | Smell Description | Design Section Updated | Update Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | `src/example-a.ts`, `src/example-core.ts` | Bidirectional dependency caused blocked implementation order. | `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/proposed-design.md` (or `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/implementation-plan.md` solution sketch for `Small`) -> boundary section | In Progress | Introduce boundary interface to remove cross-reference. |

## Remove/Rename/Legacy Cleanup Verification Log

| Date | Change ID | Item | Verification Performed | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | C-003 | `src/example-util.ts` | import/reference scan + targeted tests | Passed | No remaining references. |

## Docs Sync Log (Mandatory Post-Validation)

| Date | Docs Impact (`Updated`/`No impact`) | Files Updated | Rationale | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Updated | `docs/example-feature.md` | Runtime flow changed and new module added | Completed |

## Completion Gate

- Mark `File Status = Completed` only when implementation is done and required tests are passing or explicitly `N/A`.
- For `Rename/Move`/`Remove` tasks, verify obsolete references and dead branches are removed.
- Mark Stage 5 implementation execution complete only when:
  - implementation plan scope is delivered (or deviations are documented),
  - required unit/integration tests pass.
- Mark Stage 5.5 internal code review complete only when:
  - `internal-code-review.md` exists and gate decision is recorded,
  - file-size/SoC checks are recorded for all changed source files,
  - if gate decision is `Fail`, re-entry declaration and target stage path are recorded.
- Mark Stage 6 aggregated validation complete only when:
  - every executable in-scope acceptance criterion in the closure matrix is `Passed`,
  - critical executable API/E2E scenarios pass,
  - any infeasible acceptance criterion has explicit user waiver + documented constraints + compensating evidence + residual risk,
  - required escalation actions (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`) are resolved and logged.
- Mark Stage 7 docs sync complete only when docs synchronization result is recorded (`Updated` or `No impact` with rationale).
